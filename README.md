# Uppercase-Converter

The Uppercase-Converter project is an online tool that allows you to convert text into uppercase letters. It consists of two squares: one for entering the text and the other for displaying the converted text in real-time.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML5: Used for the structure and content of the page.
- CSS3: Used for the layout and design of the interface.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactive features and perform real-time text conversion.

## How to Use the Tool
